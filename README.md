The Kumu-3D Printer

We wish to thank Johann C. Rocholl for his groundbreaking work on the Rostock and Kossel 3D Printers. This design was derived from his work and that of many other innovators.

The Kumu-3D is a Kossel printer with a 300mm diameter build plate, silicone heater, 24v power supply, E3D hotend, and uses zero-backlash magnetic arms.
It uses 2020 extrusions and diagonal bracing, and it has a build cost of about $600 in quantity 1, including shipping.
The printable area should be over 250mm in diameter and about 200mm high.
For a taller build area, you can substitute 1000m vertical extrusions, which should yield a max height of about 450mm.
