## The Kumu-3D Printer

### *Kumu* means *teacher* in the Hawaiian language.

I wish to thank Johann C. Rocholl for his groundbreaking work on the Rostock and Kossel 3D Printers. This design was derived from his work and that of many other innovators.

The Kumu-3D is a Delta printer improving on the [Kossel Plus](http://www.kosselplus.com "Kossel Plus"), which I designed to extend and improve on Johann's original [Kossel](http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel "Kossel").

The Kumu-3D's features are:

* 300mm diameter borosilicate build plate, yielding a build area over 250mm in diameter.
* 250mm diameter 24V 250W silicone heater.
* 24v power supply, to give the motors twice as much power for faster acceleration and more precise positioning.
* E3D hotend.
* 32-bit Smoothieware controller from AZSMZ, with LCD display.
* Carbon fiber, zero-backlash magnetically jointed arms.
* 0.9&deg; motors, 1/32 stepping, 16-tooth pulleys yield 400 steps/mm with a worst case real world resolution of 20&micro;m and an average resolution of about one-third of that.
* Dampers for near silent operation.
* 2020 extrusions with diagonal bracing for increased stiffness.
* Integrated spool holder with bearings on top.
* Build cost around $600 in quantity one, including US shipping.
* With the standard 750mm vertical extrusions and 304mm arms, it should yield a maximum Z over 250mm and diameter slightly over 250mm.  With 1000mm vertical extrusions and 360mm arms, it should yield a build height of over 500mm and diameter up to 300mm.

Here is the GoogleDocs spreadsheet containing the [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ovnhxit7gjctnHXA3ArEihpogoxfmhG4zKcSKq6PfBs/edit?usp=sharing).  
I still need to add detailed individual counts for the nuts and screws.

Note: this is a *Work-in-Progress*, but I plan to have the prototype finalized by the end of April 2017, so it is ready for the start of the summer class in June 2017. Right now I'm waiting on parts to arrive.

This isn't an average printer, this is an **extraordinary** one.

I am creating this project for students at Maui College and hope it is useful to enthusiasts everywhere!  :-)

Here is a link to the extruder (designed by Shane Beeder):  [ArmDrive Bowden Extruder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:245677)  
I use the version for the Mk8 drive gear and the alternative arm which uses a 4mm nut to secure the PTFE tubing.
