## The Kumu-3D Printer

### *Kumu* means *teacher* in the Hawaiian language.

I wish to thank Johann C. Rocholl for his groundbreaking work on the Rostock and Kossel 3D Printers. This design was derived from his work and that of many other innovators.

The Kumu-3D is a Delta printer improving on the [Kossel Plus](http://www.kosselplus.com "Kossel Plus"), which I designed to extend and improve on Johann's original [Kossel](http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel "Kossel").

The Kumu-3D's features are:

* 300mm diameter borosilicate build plate, yielding a build area over 250mm in diameter.
* 250mm diameter 24V 250W silicone heater.
* 24v power supply, to give the motors twice as much power for faster acceleration and more precise positioning.
* E3D hotend.
* 32-bit Smoothieware controller from AZSMZ, with LCD display.
* Carbon fiber, zero-backlash magnetically jointed arms.
* 0.9&deg; motors, 1/32 stepping, 16-tooth pulleys yield 400 steps/mm with a worst case real resolution of 20&micro;m and a average resolution of about one-third of that.
* Dampers for silent operation.
* 2020 extrusions with diagonal bracing for increased stiffness.
* Integrated spool holder with bearings on top.
* Build cost around $600 in quantity one, including US shipping.
* With the standard 750mm vertical extrusions, it should yield a maximum Z over 250mm.  With 1000mm vertical extrusions, it should yield a build height of over 500mm.

Here is the GoogleDocs spreadsheet containing the [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ovnhxit7gjctnHXA3ArEihpogoxfmhG4zKcSKq6PfBs/edit?usp=sharing).

I still need to add the individual counts for some of the nuts and screws.

This isn't an average printer, this is an **extraordinary** one.

I am creating this project for students at Maui College and hope it is useful to enthusiasts everywhere!  :-)
